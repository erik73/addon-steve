The absolute minimum is 4GB of RAM intsalled in the host.
Depending on other apps that are installed 4GB might not be enough.

It is also important to understand that the admin_user and admin_password can not be
changed after the first start of the app, since the MariaDB database is created with
these credentials the first time the app is started.

There is no ingress support, so to reach the SteVe web interface you have to point your
browser to http://<your.homeassistant.host.ip>:8180 to login in to SteVe.
